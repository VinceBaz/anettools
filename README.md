### Tools for my projects on brain networks
========================================================

This repository is a collection of measures and tools for brain networks.
These measures mostly assume that our networks are represented as
adjacency matrices and relies on other a lot of other python modules such
as numpy, scipy, bct, netneurotools, etc.

In fact, this repository is mostly used by myself to store the functions
that I often used.

Some of these measures might someday be merged into our netneurotools
repository, which I invite you to go explore for many more amazing 
tools for network neuroscience.
