### Graph theoretical measure for annotated networks
========================================================

This repository is a collection of measures for annotated networks.
These measures mostly assume that our networks are represented as
adjacency matrices and relies on other python modules such as numpy
and scipy.

Some of these measures might someday be merged into our netneurotools
repository, which I invite you to go explore for many more amazing 
tools for network neuroscience.
