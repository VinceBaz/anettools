### Tools for my projects on brain networks
========================================================

This repository contains my own personal collection of measures and tools
for my research projects.

Some of these measures might someday be merged into our
`netneurotools<https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools>`
repository, which I invite you to go explore for many more amazing
tools for network neuroscience.
