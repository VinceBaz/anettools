### Assortativity Measures for Network (Local and Global)
========================================================

This repository is a collection of assortativity measures for networks.
These measures aim at being more flexible than those usually found in
usual network science toolbox

### CONTENT

========================================================

_assortativity_      -> Folder that stores the package for the assortativity measures

_examples.ipynb_     -> Jupyter Notebook with small examples of the measures contained
in this repository.

_data_               -> Folder that stores some data that is used for the small examples
in examples.ipynb

_experiments.ipynb_  -> Jupyter Notebook with experiments that I have tried in the last
couple of days. Given the size of the datafiles sometimes necessary for running these
experiments, these files are not stored in this repository.

__EXTRA CONTENT__

_notebook_experiments_ -> Folder that stores the results as well as the data necessary for
the experiments ran in the experiments.ipynb file. These results and the data is not
directly stored in the repository. This folder is therefore part of _.gitignore_.

### NOTE
========================================================

This repository is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. However, feel free to use it,
and let me know if any functionality is missing or incorrect
